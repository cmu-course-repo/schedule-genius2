  "units": "3",
  "description": "Data are everywhere. For policy makers, the ability to tell the right story using data can make the difference between a successful initiative and one that fails. Part art, part science, visualizing data is a process that is both well established in existing disciplines and experimental and rapidly changing in others. In this course we\u00bfll explore both ends of the spectrum as we deconstruct and reconstruct data visualizations behind some of the world\u00bfs most powerful brands, dig into our own data in compelling ways to help our readers understand complex issues, and finally experiment with new ways to represent data about our work, our community, and even ourselves. This course will provide hands-on training and experimentation with a number of tools, and students will have some flexibility to concentrate on mediums that best match their desired outcomes for a final project deliverable (print, digital, interactive or immersive). By the end of this course, students will have an introduction to a number of different tools and techniques that will allow them to immediately start applying what they\u00bfve learned to both other coursework as well as on-the-job needs.",
