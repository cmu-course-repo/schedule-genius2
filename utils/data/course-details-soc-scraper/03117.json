Students will read literature articles, design hypotheses, plan and carry out experiments, analyze and interpret data, and design future questions as part of a collaborative research team.  In addition, teams will work with faculty and fellow students to understand and explore the relevance of their projects in the field of biology and other disciplines.  Finally, teams will communicate results in an oral presentation to peers and faculty.  Students will gain research skills, analytical skills, communication skills (both written and oral), and project design skills.",
