  "description": "In this course, we will dig into the blockchain technology. We will learn from the basic, single-purpose blockchain (such as for Bitcoin) to general purpose blockchain (which includes a range of use-cases). The course will cover a broad spectrum of blockchain technology, different consensus algorithms, its various real-world use-cases - with an eye on developing our own blockchain. We will also understand various challenges with this technology, and a case-study that covers implementation in Python. This would be an interactive course and the students are expected to share ideas and their thoughts.",
