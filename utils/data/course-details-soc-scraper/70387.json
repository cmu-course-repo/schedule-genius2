We will cover issues such pricing of technology products/services including versioning, bundling and dynamic pricing; the impact of network effects within product markets; competition in technology-focused product arenas; the design, launch and governance of platform markets. Examples of technology-intensive industries that we will discuss are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications, e-commerce, and the sharing economy. Students explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances.
