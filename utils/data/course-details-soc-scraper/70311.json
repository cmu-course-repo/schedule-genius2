Your ability to do well depends on having an understanding of the human side of management. This course introduces insights and tools from the behavioral and social sciences that will improve your ability to think and act strategically in these situations. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher. If so, the third-party course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the third-party course material provided. The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the University's cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from $13 to $75.",
