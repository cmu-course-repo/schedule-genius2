  "description": "Data drives modern business. Transactional data systems keep the world's economy operating smoothly by tracking and processing the movement of bits, money, atoms, and attention across the planet. Analytic systems help managers understand and optimize their businesses. Robotic systems (both physical machines and software bots) are automating a tremendous amount of the work that has historically been done by people. In this course you will learn to use a set of data management tools to capture, manage, analyze, and understand data so to help your organization do business better, faster, and cheaper. This course was previously titled Modern Data Management. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.
