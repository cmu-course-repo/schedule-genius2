  "description": "This course builds on the principles and methods of statistical reasoning developed in 36-200 (or its equivalents). The course covers simple and multiple regression, basic analysis of variance methods, logistic regression, and introduction to data mining including classification and clustering. Students will also learn the principles of overfitting, training vs testing, ensemble methods, variable selection, and bootstrapping.   Course objectives include applying the basic principles and methods that underlie statistical practice and empirical research to real data sets and interdisciplinary problems. Learning the Data Analysis Pipeline is strongly emphasized through structured coding and data analysis projects. In addition to three lectures a week, students attend a computer lab once a week for \"hands-on\" practice of the material covered in lecture.  There is no programming language pre-requisite.  Students will learn the basics of R Markdown and related analytics tools.",
