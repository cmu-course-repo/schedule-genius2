  "description": "This course provides an overview of  thermodynamics, kinetics and chemical equilibrium. Topics include the flow of energy in chemical systems; the spontaneity of chemical processes, i.e. entropy and free energy; the mechanisms and rates of chemical reactions; and the use of chemical equilibrium to reason about acid-base chemistry, solubility and electrochemistry. Applications include the energy economy, biological systems and environmental chemistry. 3 hrs. lec., 2 hrs. rec.",
