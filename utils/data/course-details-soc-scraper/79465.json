  "description": "This course will examine the arts in Qatar, both historically and in the present. We will focus especially on art exhibits and musical events scheduled by the city's museums and concert halls during the Spring 2020 semester. The \"curriculum\" will derive from the artistic presentations themselves, which will provide a springboard for reading assignments and research papers in the history of music and art. We will also examine the historical development of cultural institutions in Qatar.",
