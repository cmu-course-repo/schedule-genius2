  "description": "This course allows students to engage in experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theories from their academic discipline within a relevant professional context. This should include a meaningful project at the internship site where practical application and skills development occurs relevant to the student's major. The internship can be at an internal (CMU) or external site. Students will need to complete a proposal and supervisor agreement form to be eligible. Students are responsible for finding internships. In addition to the time spent at the internship site, students will be expected to write a short paper explaining the application of knowledge and theories as well as skills developed at the internship site as they relate to professional career goals. The course is not eligible for CPT for international students; please contact the Office for International Education for more information. Enrollment in this Internship course is BY SPECIAL PERMISSION ONLY.  Variable units are decided on a case-by-case basis.  THIS COURSE CANNOT BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS.  Please contact Dr. Korryn Mozisek, Director of Integrative Learning, Office of the Vice Provost for Education, to discuss your individual internship requirements at: kmozisek@andrew.cmu.edu; Phone: 412-268-3441 or Colleen Mollenauer, cmollena@andrew.cmu.edu; 412-268-3027.",
