The course will revisit in more detail the methods for examining the relationship between two variables and will also expand the methods to cases where there is more than one explanatory variable. The course includes an introduction to the R studio statistical programming environment through labs and homeworks. Skills in course methodology, concepts, and data scientific verbal expression will be synthesized in two written data analysis projects.  Students produce and engage with an array of representations in R of descriptions, displays, models, and predictions, of real data.  In each weekly lab as well as on all homeworks and projects, data is explored, described, and modeled using R.  Coding skills relevant to the course are developed from the ground up.  In addition to relevant statistical and machine learning applications, students practice some elementary data cleaning, learn and experience the importance of reproducibility, and are introduced to the importance of commenting code. Issues of model selection, and the danger and issues of overfitting, are covered in a variety of contexts.  Issues involving algorithmic bias and data ethics are also discussed.", "short_name": "REASONING DATA", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "taeyongp", "first_name": "Taeyong", "last_name": "Park", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 578, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2020}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2021}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2022}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2023}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [{"units": 9.0, "code": "36-207", "id": 604, "name": "Probability and Statistics for Business Applications"}, {"units": 9.0, "code": "36-247", "id": 634, "name": "Statistics for Lab Sciences"}, {"units": 9.0, "code": "70-207", "id": 1802, "name": "Probability and Statistics for Business Applications"}], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Reasoning with Data", "base_name": "Reasoning with Data", "skills": [], "success": true, "attributes": [{"type": "attribute", "name": "communication", "id": 1}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "ethics", "id": 5}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "for non-majors", "id": 6}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "lab component", "id": 11}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "research", "id": 14}]}
