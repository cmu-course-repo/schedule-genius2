The other option is to take two half-semester mini courses. If you like the idea of engaging in a sustained focus throughout the semester, this full-semester course may be a good option for you. Our full-semester courses offer students the opportunity to read deeply about a controversial issue or topic. Students acquire strategies for reading, forming research questions, and writing research proposals and articles, in order to contribute an original argument to an ongoing field of inquiry. Some students report a flexible, \"marathon\" pace throughout the course, driven by the lack of a mid-semester break.", "learning_resources": "materials available through Canvas", "extra_time_commitment": "1:1 conferences with faculty about your writing"}, "equiv": [{"units": 9.0, "code": "76-102", "id": 4567, "name": "Advanced First Year Writing: Special Topics"}, {"units": 4.5, "code": "76-108", "id": 8680, "name": "Writing about Public Problems"}, {"units": 4.5, "code": "76-107", "id": 8681, "name": "Writing about Data"}, {"units": 4.5, "code": "76-106", "id": 8682, "name": "Writing about Literature, Art and Culture"}], "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "min_units": 9.0, "offering_tags": [{"sem": 1, "type": "INFO", "name": "specific_sem"}, {"sem": 2, "type": "INFO", "name": "specific_sem"}, {"sem": 3, "type": "INFO", "name": "specific_sem"}], "units": 9.0, "website": "https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/academic-programs/writing-and-communication/index.html", "long_desc": "Interpretation and Argument is a foundational, inquirydriven writing course that introduces students to a variety of strategies for making compositional decisions in writing and communication. Within the course, students learn genrebased skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method to learn how to use models to take on new writing tasks, including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76101 typically select texts, ranging from scholarly texts, journalism, and film, about an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, researchbased instruction, practice, and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear, wellsupported, readeroriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners, students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.
