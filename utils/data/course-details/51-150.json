What are your dreams? What career do you hope to pursue? What provides meaning to your life and satisfaction? What kind of person do you hope to become? Emily Dickinson said \"the future is dark\" because it is difficult to see. The \"Design your life\" micro course helps students to shed light on the futures they hope to live into. Greek philosopher Socrates said \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". I this course we explore what it means to live a good life. A life well lived requires reflection, meaningful values, living intentionally, and adapting to change. Michelle Obama's autobiography is titled \"Becoming\" because she imagines herself as a work in process. Hopefully, you too are on a trajectory of \"becoming\" the best possible version of yourself as your life unfolds. One of the most important design projects anyone can undertake is the design of their life. To design one's life, goals and values need to be clear. This is a lifelong project that unfolds day by day and it is sometimes difficult to know where and how to begin. \u00bf Sometimes students are unclear about what their values are or how to speak about them confidently. \u00bf Clarity on one's goals and values allows one to be more confident when interviewing for jobs. \u00bf Rarely are students given the time and guidance to imagine their personal futures and the time to explore what matters most to them. The Design Your Life micro course helps students to articulate what matters most to them for their current life stage. The reflective process that they learn can be repeated throughout their lives to navigate decision points and chart their trajectories.", "learning_resources": "(1) Readings and viewings are assigned.
