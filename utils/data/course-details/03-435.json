From the perspective of a cancer cell, we will learn about basic concepts of cell division, DNA replication, cell signaling, cell cycle control, cell metabolism, the regulation of gene expression in human cells, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, mutations, the process of metastasis, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatments and ethical questions surrounding treating patients, the epidemiology of cancer including prevalence and historical trends in diagnosis, as well as social impacts of a cancer diagnosis. Students will also explore the primary literature and scientific review articles to better understand research and methods of investigation into the cellular and molecular processes of tumorigenesis. This course will include interactive lectures, guest speakers, and in class discussion exercises aimed at building class participation and association, as well as confidence in public speaking about the sciences.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Students should have a foundational knowledge of genetics and cell biology.

Also, understand how cancer treatments kill cancer cells, and how treatments impact the body, mind and life of the patient.6 Read primary articles, grasp the hypothesis tested, capture the key findings, and critically assess the value of the studies and their impact on cancer therapeutics. From this, students can join conversations related to recent scientific research discoveries in cancer biology and gain an appreciation for the challenges of performing cancer research and taking that research to the bedside.", "relevance": "Students will develop skills in reading, interpreting, analyzing, and communicating about the primary literature in cancer research.
