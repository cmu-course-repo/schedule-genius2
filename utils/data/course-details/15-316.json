Understanding the security and privacy needs of software, and being able to rigorously demonstrate that those needs are met, is key to eliminating vulnerabilities that cause these issues. Students who take this course will learn the principles needed to make these assurances about software, and some of the key strategies used to make sure that they are correctly implemented in practice. Topics include policy models and mechanisms for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, languagebased techniques for detecting and preventing security threats, mechanisms for enforcing privacy guarantees, and the interaction between software and underlying systems that can give rise to practical security threats. Students will also gain experience applying many of these techniques to write code that is secure by construction.", "short_name": "SFTWR FNDTN SEC PRIV", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "rdriley", "first_name": "Ryan", "last_name": "Riley", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 723, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2020}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2022}], "photo_url": null}, {"username": "greis", "first_name": "Giselle", "last_name": "Reis", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 636, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2020}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2021}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2023}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "(15-213 at least C)", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 12.0, "code": "15-213", "id": 3113, "name": "Introduction to Computer Systems"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 3113}], "id": 3114, "screen_name": "15-213"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 9857}, {"data": {"grade": "C", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of C", "type": "mingrade", "id": 9858}], "id": 8841, "screen_name": "uqrtdd70fqb678p"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 9856}], "id": 8840, "screen_name": "3ycrronbgslb5yk"}}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Software Foundations of Security and Privacy", "base_name": "Software Foundations of Security and Privacy", "skills": [{"id": 337, "name": "Security", "slug": "security"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
