Overall, we will consider the causes, processes, and experiences shaping the arrival of different immigrant groups to the United States at different historical moments. More specifically, we will follow migrations of different groups of people, like African Americans, north and westward European immigrants into coastal port cities and beyond Mexican bracero workers into agricultural industries Chinese laborers work experiences in diverse economic settings and more. We will apply critical lenses toward movements like Americanization and try to understand different groups of citizens divergent experiences with national belonging. We will also interrogate the logics, values, and symbols that shaped ideas regarding ethnic, racial, class, and gender difference, particularly as they were used to characterize difference regarding citizenship.", "short_name": "20TH CENTURY US HIS", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "aaronmij", "first_name": "", "last_name": "", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 117, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2019}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "20th Century U.S. History", "base_name": "20th Century U.S. History", "skills": [], "success": true, "attributes": [{"type": "attribute", "name": "communication", "id": 1}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "diversity", "id": 3}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "for non-majors", "id": 6}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "reading intensive", "id": 13}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "writing intensive", "id": 18}]}
