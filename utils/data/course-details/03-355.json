This course covers the progress of stem cell research and its application to tissue engineering and regenerative therapy. The students will learn about the different types of stem cells, the biochemical stimuli that are responsible for regulating stem cell differentiation and techniques involved in the culture of stem cells. This subject will also highlight the development of various biomaterials that are used as biological substitutes in regenerative therapy. Current and emergent stem cell technologies in selected applications of tissue engineering in bone, skin and vascular tissues will be emphasized. The course will be delivered through problembased learning where students are expected to participate in discussions, perform literature search, present their findings through presentations and written reports on selected topics.
