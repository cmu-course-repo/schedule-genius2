Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensorylevel mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with topdown processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.
