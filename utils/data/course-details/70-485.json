Placing an ad, pitching a press release to a trade journal editor, sponsoring a booth at a trade show\u00bfthose actions showed that a business owner or marketing manager was doing the right stuff. And the more you did, the better. But no longer. Today's pressure-packed marketplace is very different. There's more competition, more informed consumers and customers and more at stake.\n\nTo give companies a competitive edge, marketers created branding and have started to figure out how, when and where to use assorted techniques that take relatively minor and sometimes insignificant differences between products, services or ideas and magnify those differences in such a way that someone else is willing to select and pay more for the branded item over the non-branded one.\n\nTo complicate matters even further, you used to be able to establish national and global brands relatively systematically through big media buys in traditional channels, like TV, radio and newspapers. Now, the media and marketing channels have become so fragmented that building a brand has become perhaps more of an \"art\" than a \"science.\"\n\nSince the best way to learn something is to actually do it, Product and Brand Management is a project class. Through real-world client cases (from organizations who will listen to your recommendations and presentations, we will hold three \"Agency Shootouts.\" These are mini-case competitions based off of information provided in class. Also, either by yourself or with a handful of teammates, you will be asked to conduct your own brand assessment (primary and secondary marketing research) and come up with a recommendation and plan for improving a real product, service or company brand (preferably one that you have a client connection to and is not necessarily an established, national brand that most everyone has already heard of).
