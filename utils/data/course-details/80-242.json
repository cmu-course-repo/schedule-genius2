You must then be prepared to negotiate with others to get your job done, to advance your career, and even to maintain meaningful personal relationships with your family and friends. The purpose of this course is to help prepare you for these negotiations. In particular, in this course, you will reflect on your current approaches to conflict, study the nature of conflict and why it tends to escalate, and develop your own skills for principled negotiation. Throughout the course you will also participate in negotiation simulations exercising your powers of communication and persuasion while practicing conflict resolution tactics. My goal is that you finish this course a more reflective and effective negotiator, better prepared to handle the conflicts you will inevitably face.", "short_name": "CONFLT DISPTE RESLTN", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "degray", "first_name": "", "last_name": "", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 932, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2018}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2015}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2017}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2019}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [{"units": 9.0, "code": "70-321", "id": 2928, "name": "Negotiation and Conflict Resolution"}], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Conflict and Dispute Resolution", "base_name": "Conflict and Dispute Resolution", "skills": [], "success": true, "attributes": []}
