In this course, we will discuss how history shaped France and her relationship to the Muslim population. By studying the roots of MuslimChristian relations, we can understand the complexities and challenges of living in France today.   We will study literary texts such as Aucassin et Nicolette, examine the role of the Crusades, and investigate their longterm effects through the Algerian War. Side by side with history, we will examine the contemporary climate of MuslimChristian relationships in modern France through presentday events, changes in the law, and film to understand political changes and social situations.
