Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as deep learning, familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their deep learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuousevaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project. There will be six handson assignments, requiring both lowlevel coding and toolkitbased implementation of neural networks, covering basic MLP, convolutional and recurrent formalisms, as well as one or more advanced tasks, in addition to the final project.", "short_name": "INTRO.
