Sections 1A EXP GENETICS TECH This course is designed to complement the Laboratory Course Experimental Techniques in Molecular Biology ACT. This laboratory course is designed to teach experimental methods of modern biology. Experiments in microbial genetics, molecular biology, and eukaryotic genetics are performed. Emphasis is placed on understanding and applying the biological principles of each experiment. This course is designed to be taken during the junior year. Experimentation using living organisms andor their tissues, cells, or molecules is an essential component of this course 8 units. Section W Frontiers of Biotechnology The first half of this course will introduce students to the revolution in genome editing biotechnology based on the CRISPR bacterial immune system. Specific topics include CRISPR moving parts, discovery and diversity of CRISPR systems, CRISPR implementation in mammals, and other mammalian genetic engineering systems. We will view these topics in the context of applications in biotechnology and human genetic diseases. The second half of the course will focus on new developments in immunology and will cover topics such as immunotherapy of cancer and advances in vaccine development 9 units.", "short_name": "SP TPCS IN BIOLOGY", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "rule", "first_name": "Gordon", "last_name": "Rule", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 1869, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2019}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2021}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "(03-231 at least D) or (03-232 at least D)", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "03-231", "id": 4198, "name": "Honors Biochemistry"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 4198}], "id": 4199, "screen_name": "03-231"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 2874403}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 2874404}], "id": 2557514, "screen_name": "5t2zpzy83uz5jlw"}, {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "03-232", "id": 4201, "name": "Biochemistry I"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 4201}], "id": 4202, "screen_name": "03-232"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 2874405}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 2874406}], "id": 2557515, "screen_name": "k1a8gi6qf8ydrjm"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": false}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 2874402}], "id": 2557513, "screen_name": "u13z3hrcx3rc2hb"}}, "is_req_repeatable": true, "topic": null, "name": "Special Topics in Biological Sciences", "base_name": "Special Topics in Biological Sciences", "skills": [{"id": 32, "name": "Biotechnology", "slug": "biotechnology"}, {"id": 169, "name": "Genetics", "slug": "genetics"}, {"id": 1810, "name": "Edition", "slug": "edition"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
