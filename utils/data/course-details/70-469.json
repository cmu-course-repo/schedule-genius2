The homework should be done in teams of two (or three) students that are formed at the beginning of the semester and retained throughout: The homework is to work on a case study that involves the end-to-end analysis of a real data set. Each homework submission will involve submitting a short update report (PDF file of 3-5 pages) and a code workbook in R or Excel - To aid your analysis, simple scripts or workbooks will be provided as a template for each such assignment. In your report, I would like a careful description of the main findings - plan to formulate your charts and tables so that the most interesting ones can be repurposed for your final presentation and report.", "goals": "On completing the course, you should be able toTranslate a datadriven business problem to analytical models based on their underlying purpose, available data, solution methods, evaluation metrics and deployment strategies.Make judicious modeling choices in the different stages of the translation using your knowledge of the techniques used in different analytical models.Communicate the results of technical business data analysis models to all stakeholders to convince them of its value, validity, effectiveness and risks in eventual deployment.Prototype business analytics models using R and Excel, and use them in all the steps above.", "relevance": "Deriving value from business data is an integrative process.

The course will introduce and build models in Excel and R, a free programming language used ubiquitously in modern analytics ecosystems. Prior programming experience is not required. Class sessions will introduce new ideas every week that will be typically be followed up by walking through a prototype model in R or Excel.\n\nSoftware: We will use R and Excel to develop prototype models for this class. We will use R studio for model development in R. All in-class labs and the homework related to the class project will involve starting from scripts provided, understanding them, interpreting the results and modifying them to extend and deepen the analysis.", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "equiv": [], "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "min_units": 9.0, "offering_tags": [{"type": "INFO", "name": "intermittent"}], "units": 9.0, "website": null, "long_desc": "Deriving value from business data is an integrative process.
