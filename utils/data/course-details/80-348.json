This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global public health and its intersection with claims of human rights.  We will focus on theoretical accounts of human rights and questions arising from them What constitutes a human right, and on what basis or bases might the existence of human rights be defended  If human rights exist, whose responsibility is it to see that they are defendedprovidednot violated, and why What is the relationship between health deficits and human rights deficits, and what would a human right to health look like  Are global institutions such as the protection of strong intellectual property rights consistent with respect for a human right to health", "short_name": "HLTH DVLPT INT RIGHT", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "degray", "first_name": "", "last_name": "", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 932, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2016}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2018}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Health, Human Rights, and International Development", "base_name": "Health, Human Rights, and International Development", "skills": [{"id": 1562, "name": "Drinks", "slug": "drinks"}], "success": true, "attributes": [{"type": "attribute", "name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "ethics", "id": 5}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "global", "id": 7}, {"type": "attribute", "name": "writing intensive", "id": 18}]}
