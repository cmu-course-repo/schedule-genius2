This seminar will examine the scientific research that has illuminated the nature of autism, focusing on its cognitive and biological aspects. For example, language, perception, and theory of mind are affected in autism. The readings will include a few short books and many primary journal articles. The readings will deal primarily with autism in people whose IQs are in the normal range high functioning autism. Seminar members will be expected to regularly enter to class discussions and make presentations based on the readings.     The seminar will examine various domains of thinking and various biological underpinnings of brain function, to converge on the most recent scientific consensus on the biological and psychological characterization of autism.  There will be a special focus on brain imaging studies of autism, including both structural MRI imaging of brain morphology and functional fMRI and PET imaging of brain activation during the performance of various tasks.", "short_name": "AUTISM: PSYCH PERSPC", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "jbruder", "first_name": "Jennifer", "last_name": "Bruder", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 3435, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2018}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2019}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2021}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2022}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2023}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "(85-211 at least D) or (85-213 at least D) or (85-429 at least D) or (85-355 at least D) or (85-219 at least D)", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "85-211", "id": 4034, "name": "Cognitive Psychology"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 4034}], "id": 4035, "screen_name": "85-211"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59116}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 59117}], "id": 46769, "screen_name": "agikg6jcurd5rbl"}, {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "85-213", "id": 4035, "name": "Human Information Processing and Artificial Intelligence"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 4035}], "id": 4036, "screen_name": "85-213"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59118}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 59119}], "id": 46770, "screen_name": "qtwdt3nlqumvmot"}, {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "85-429", "id": 756, "name": "Cognitive Brain Imaging"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 756}], "id": 757, "screen_name": "85-429"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59120}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 59121}], "id": 46771, "screen_name": "nwuoa797ezx0xaa"}, {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "85-355", "id": 7289, "name": "Neuroscience and the City"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 8788}], "id": 8191, "screen_name": "85-355"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59122}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 59123}], "id": 46772, "screen_name": "yaih4qtesv4cl1s"}, {"default_concentration": false, "is_concentration": false, "is_uni_req": false, "is_shared": false, "choices": [{"constraints": [{"data": {"course": {"units": 9.0, "code": "85-219", "id": 4033, "name": "Biological Foundations of Behavior"}}, "type_string": "", "type": "course", "id": 58719}], "id": 45935, "screen_name": "85-219"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": true}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59124}, {"data": {"grade": "D", "only_transfer_status": false, "only_non_transfer_status": false}, "type_string": "Minimum grade of D", "type": "mingrade", "id": 59125}], "id": 46773, "screen_name": "53xiyhwr9ly86w0"}], "constraints": [{"data": {"x": 1, "is_and": false}, "type": "anyxof", "id": 59115}], "id": 46768, "screen_name": "f0b7o6q9qo139rd"}}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Autism: Psychological and Neuroscience Perspectives", "base_name": "Autism: Psychological and Neuroscience Perspectives", "skills": [{"id": 1346, "name": "Petting", "slug": "petting"}, {"id": 1871, "name": "Focus: Psychology Of Deal Making", "slug": "focus-psychology-of-deal-making"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
