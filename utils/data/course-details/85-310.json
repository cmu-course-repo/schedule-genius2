No background in Eprime is necessary, but a general familiarity with computer programming is useful.", "assessment_structure": "Students will take quizzes related to the textbook and will do in-class activities and discussion for credit. Students will write up two research projects during this course. For the second project, students will need to create an original experiment from start to finish, including: experimental design, creating stimuli, creating a program to present the stimuli, and analyzing data. For each project, students will produce a paper in APA format that will be graded. In addition, for the final project, there will be a poster session presenting the research to the Psychology department. Posters will be assessed on the clarity of their content, adherence to APA format, and students' ability to answer questions about the research.", "goals": "The broad aim of this course is to teach students the skills and concepts necessary to create, report, and evaluate scientific knowledge about human cognition. In addition to class lectures and discussions, students will participate in projects designed to introduce them to representative experiments in the field. Students will design and conduct a pilot research project, gain an understanding of research methodology, and enhance their ability to analyze and communicate research findings. If successful, this course will improve a students ability to1. recognize and apply basic principles of scientific research, measurement, and experimental design2. consider ethical issues associated with research 3. use library and other resources to find out what is known about a research topic4. design and conduct a research project5. communicate research findings effectively, both orally and in writing6. evaluate others research critically and constructively.", "relevance": "This course fulfills a requirement for most Psychology-affiliated majors.
