The course will build on the knowledge you have gained from the prerequisite courses we will develop your modelbuilding skills, explore some techniqueoriented skills such as linear, integer, and nonlinear programming, and experiment with heuristic solution methods. While going through different models and techniques, we will also see realworld examples of how these models are actually used in practical business environments. This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the thirdparty course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the thirdparty course material provided.
