We are constantly evaluating and interpreting data from our environment, in everything from spreadsheets to Instagram posts. At the same time, our own personal data are being observed and recordedthrough websites we visit online, our smart devices, and even our interactions with other students and faculty at CMU. Navigating this data universe requires knowledge of what data is and how to use it responsibly. For example, can a plant be a data set Discovering the truth behind a piece of data, including who made it, what it looks like, and what we can learn from it, is a critical skill. Understanding data can be the difference between being able to distinguish truth from lies and the key to identifying your data footprint and succeeding in research and in your career. In this course, we will explore the data universe from multiple angles and across several types of data. We will define, find, and analyze data, and most importantly, identify narratives within data to tell stories about the world around us. We will examine data using the following questions How can we tell multiple stories from the same dataset What biases can exist in data And, who creates or decides what data matters enough to collect, preserve, and share NOTE There will be one in person and one virtual prerecorded lecture each week.", "short_name": "DISCVR DATA", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "eslayton", "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Slayton", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 3616, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2022}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Discovering the Data Universe", "base_name": "Discovering the Data Universe", "skills": [], "success": true, "attributes": []}
