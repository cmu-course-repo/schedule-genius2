This course presents a broad view of astronomy, straightforwardly descriptive and without any complex mathematics. The goal of the course is to encourage nontechnical students to become scientifically literate and to appreciate new developments in the world of science, especially in the rapidly developing field of astronomy. Subjects covered include the solar system, stars, galaxies and the universe as a whole. The student should develop an appreciation of the everchanging universe and our place within it. Computer laboratory exercises will be used to gain practical experience in astronomical techniques. In addition, small telescopes will be used to study the sky. This course is specifically geared toward nonscienceengineering majors.", "short_name": "INTRO TO ASTRONOMY", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "nkaloger", "first_name": "", "last_name": "", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 1877, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2016}], "photo_url": null}, {"username": "mzayed", "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Zayed", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 1073, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2019}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2020}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2022}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2023}], "photo_url": null}, {"username": "sabarji", "first_name": "", "last_name": "", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 2828, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 2, "year": 2016}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Introduction to Astronomy", "base_name": "Introduction to Astronomy", "skills": [{"id": 205, "name": "Astronomy", "slug": "astronomy"}, {"id": 1602, "name": "Ageing", "slug": "ageing"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
