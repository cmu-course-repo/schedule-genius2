Together we will examine the different ways the three states responded to internal and external crises and transformed into modern nationhood. We will also consider interpretations of the past that continue to impact how East Asians today perceive themselves, their countries, and international relations. Some of the topics covered will include globalization, imperialism, nationalism, scientific developments, and the role of historical memory as in Nanking, Hiroshima and the Korean War.
