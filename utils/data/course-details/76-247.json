In addition to watching the professional players onstage, spectators also participated in a form of play themselves, in a sense, because theatrical experience provided a unique opportunity to engage imaginatively with otherwise inaccessible people, worlds, and ideas. More than four hundred years later, the drama of the period now ranks among the most esteemed texts in all English literature, and the name Shakespeare has become a byword for literary genius. This course will offer a selection of Shakespeares delightfuland sometimes surprisingly edgycomedies and late romances. As we read through these works, we will endeavor to understand what, and how, they meant in their original context, thereby developing a historically informed perspective on their influence over our own cultural landscape.", "short_name": "SHAKESPEARE COM&ROM", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Shakespeare: Comedies and Romances", "base_name": "Shakespeare: Comedies and Romances", "skills": [{"id": 1757, "name": "Comedy", "slug": "comedy"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
