This takes the form of virtual labs that mimic closely the actually experiment. In so doing, they are able to come into the lab prepared to perform the analysis.\no\tStudents' technique skills and knowledge of mathematical concepts required for the course (in terms of precision and accuracy) are assessed through submission of data and summary sheets and accuracy scores. The data and summary sheets allow us to determine whether or not they understand the math required to analyze their data. The accuracy scores provide a measure of how good their techniques is. Students are often provided analytical unknowns whose concentrations are well known.\no\tDepth of understanding of the technique and its application are assessed through written lab reports and exams. Three lab reports and three exams are given throughout the semester with each covering the key topics: Titrations, Spectroscopy (& Chromatography) and Gravimetric Analysis.\no\tGroup work as well as technique application are assessed through the team project grade. Students are asked to select a group for team projects. This group then uses one or two of the techniques learned within the semester to analyze a real- world sample. They are graded on the poster they present to their peers as well as on their overall lab work.", "goals": "To learn how to work safely in a chemical laboratoryTo read and recognize hazards associated with chemicals and thus how to properly dispose of them. To be able to identify and understand the use of laboratory glasswareequipmentTo acquire fundamental laboratory skills such as measuring weights, pipetting, titrating and use of volumetric glasswareTo develop technique such that measurements are performed precisely and accuratelyTo correctly utilize mathematically concepts in chemistry to solving problems To become familiar with the use analytical instruments such as the UVVis and AA spectrophotometer as well as the HPLC.To manage time so that the lab analysis can be completed in the shortest possible time without sacrificing accuracy.To develop powers of observation and thus learn to record in and maintain a laboratory notebook. To communicate findings results to a general audience in written format.To further develop problem solving critical thinking skills so that they are able to understand how to use the techniques learnt on real world samplesTo learn how to use basic reference manuals in chemical literatureTo work as a member of a team to complete a more advance projectTo understand how to summarize results effectively in a poster for presentation to peers.

Students will thus apply the knowledge that they have learnt in these courses in a lab setting. They will gain both the knowledge and experience of working in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The course itself teaches them how to identify and use laboratory equipment, prepare solutions, perform titrations, use modern day analytical instruments such as a UV-Vis and AA spectrophotometer and HPLC.

The syllabus, lecture notes, recitation activities and exam material are all provided on Canvas. Canvas is updated daily/weekly.\n-\tThe textbook \"Exploring Chemical Analysis\" 6th edition by Daniel C Harris is referenced throughout the course. Purchase of the textbook is optional. Copies of the newest edition and older editions are on reserve in the Sorrells library in Wean Hall.\n-\tStudents are given an 'in house' lab manual that provide information regarding safety, how to write notebook, how to write reports, introductory background information on the experiment, as well as procedural information for the experiment. The manual also reference suggest problems from the Harris textbook.\n-\tStudents are provided with an outline of lecture notes at the start of each lecture.\n-\tStudents are provided with online videos that cover how to use each of the glassware/ equipment that they will be using throughout the semester\n-\tStudents are provided with video tutorials demonstrating how to solve suggested problems given in the lab manual\n-\tStudents are encouraged to use Piazza (online discussion forum) to ask questions.
