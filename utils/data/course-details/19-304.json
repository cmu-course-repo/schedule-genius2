As a byproduct of the course, students will learn a number of elementary cryptographic constructions, which will help them build a sound foundational basis for more advanced courses in cryptography and computer security. By the end of the 9unit variant of the course, students are able to reason about cryptocurrencies, both from a technological perspective, and from a legal and regulatory perspective. They know the most important recent developments in cryptocurrencies and blockchains, and can describe them and determine whether these technologies are applicable to certain industry sectors. This proposed microcourse roughly corresponds to the first third of the 17303 course taught in Pittsburgh it provides the basics and will be selfcontained. It could potentially be followed by an elementary microcourse primarily covering scripting and novel consensus mechanisms, and potentially by an advanced microcourse covering advanced topics such as anonymous cryptocurrencies, deanonymization, and so forth.", "relevance": "This course is of interest to both computer science students with an interest in cryptocurrencies, and who want to learn more about the financial and public policy implications, and to finance students who have an interest in understanding technical underpinnings of cryptocurrencies and blockchains", "learning_resources": "We will work with both the Bitcoin textbook and the Handbook of Applied Cryptography, both of which are freely available online.
