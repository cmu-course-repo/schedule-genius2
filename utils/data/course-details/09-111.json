It is structured around phenomena relevant to modern society, research, and technology rather than the conceptual tools i.e. systems or application, rather than contentdriven.  Many of the conceptual tools e.g. structure, interaction between energy and matter, interparticle forces, reaction stoichiometry, thermodynamics and kinetics  are used throughout the course, to help reinforce these ideas and promote an integrated understanding.
