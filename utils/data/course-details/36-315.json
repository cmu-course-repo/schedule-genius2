Furthermore, students will design graphs to explore data, test hypotheses, form research questions, and communicate accurate and honest arguments, such that their graphs are easily understandable for technical and nontechnical audiences. Along the way, students will learn how to argue why certain design choices were made for a graph, and describe graphs concisely and accurately to technical and nontechnical audiences in writing and orally. Finally, students will assess and critique statistical graphics in popular media this includes describing the strengths and weaknesses of a given graphical design, as well as communicating how a graphical design can be improved.", "relevance": "Dietrich GenEd prior to Fall 2021: Creating\nDietrich GenEd after Fall 2021: Disciplinary Perspectives: Design\n\nStudents will learn how to create graphs such that they address the three key elements of graphical design: The data structure, the graph's audience, and the designer's intended message. Furthermore, students will gain a better understanding of how appropriate statistical analyses can complement their graphs. Students will also gain a greater appreciation/understanding for statistical methods (like linear regression) by learning how to visualize these methods and their underlying statistical uncertainty.

This course introduces students to the most common forms of graphical displays and their uses and misuses. Ideally, graphs are designed according to three key elements The data structure, the graphs audience, and the designers intended message. Students will learn how to create welldesigned graphs and understand them from a statistical perspective. Furthermore, the course will consider complex data structures that are becoming increasingly common in data visualizations temporal, spatial, and text data we will discuss common ways to process these data that make them easy to visualize. As time permits, we may also consider more advanced graphical methods e.g., interactive graphics and computergenerated animations. In addition to two weekly lectures, there will be weekly computer labs and homework assignments where students use R to visualize and analyze real datasets. Along the way, students also make monthly Piazza posts discussing the strengths and weaknesses of a graph they found online, thereby critiquing real graphical designs found in the wild. The course culminates in a group final project, where students make publicfacing data visualizations and analyses for a real dataset. All assignments will be in R although this is not a programming class, using programmingbased statistical software like R is essential to create modernday graphics, and this class will give you practice using this kind of software. Throughout, communication skills usually written or visual, but sometimes spoken will play an important role. Indeed, if its true that a picture speaks a thousand words, then ideally the one thousand words you are communicating with your graphics are statistically correct, clear, and compelling.",
