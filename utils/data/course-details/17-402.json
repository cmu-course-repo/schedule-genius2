An understanding of technical as well as societal / policy challenges (including for example, congruence with UN SDG goals) is important for professionals and future leaders in society. Given that CMU-Q has students hailing from countries ranging from Albania to Vietnam, the unique aspects at the cross-section of AI and emerging economies are worth delving into. Key concepts - via a diverse set of case studies - will be presented and analyzed. The focus will be on critical and creative thinking; and, problem solving using data and AI. The course will also provide an opportunity to work in diverse, cross-border teams (for the projects). Relevance and creative uses of local data and domain knowledge will be illustrated. Opinions from other thought leaders - via guest lectures - will round out the content. The syllabus will be informed by the instructor's recent experience with the global course around AI Grand Challenges. Many of the class projects therein touched upon emerging economy issues and that is where the idea for this course germinated! Also, the course will underscore the importance of better communication and consensus - a sine qua non for trust and access - among AI producers and AI consumers (a majority of whom are based in emerging economies).", "learning_resources": "Case studies such as: https://www.wired.com/story/clever-strategy-distribute-covid-aid-satellite-data/ https://www.mosip.io/ https://sunbird.org/ (and the general concept of Digital Public Goods and possible AI overlays) along w/ the instructor's research / articles such as: https://www.rediff.com/business/column/what-is-made-in-india-ai/20191125.htm Artificial Intelligence's Grand Challenges: Past, Present, and Future (w/ commentary from six thought leaders incl.
