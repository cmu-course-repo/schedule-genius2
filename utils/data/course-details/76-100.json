These students may be required to take a placement exam administered by the university prior to the Fall semester. Students who take this course qualify through this placement exam. Alternatively, students can choose to forgo the placement exam if they prefer to enroll in 76-100 during their first semester.\n\n76-100 requires a different set of written assignments and focuses on a different set of skills than the other First-Year Writing course offerings. It is not an easier version of these other courses; it is a completely different course.

The course emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles. Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. All sections are offered MWF.
