The first fundamental idea is stakeholders need an interesting and organized pretask environment as a precursor to engaging with a task. A pretask environment is one that invites stakeholders to engage with and stay in a designed space because they can see that they will enjoy performing tasks that meet their goals. This useful, usable, and desirable task environment is developed by exploring compositional guidelines, color theory, and basic typography. With pretask knowledge in hand, students explore meaningmaking that emerges through the synthesis of image, word, and typeface as they design and prototype interactive solutions to problems that real users face, employing user studies and usability evaluations to create effective solutions.", "short_name": "DESIGN FUNDAMENTAL", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "acheek", "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Cheek", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 2822, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2015}, {"semester": 1, "year": 2016}], "photo_url": null}, {"username": "zizan", "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "Hagan", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 175, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2017}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2019}, {"semester": 2, "year": 2020}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Design Fundamentals: Shaping Interactions and Experiences", "base_name": "Design Fundamentals: Shaping Interactions and Experiences", "skills": [{"id": 1348, "name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"id": 1539, "name": "Promotional Design", "slug": "promotional-design"}, {"id": 1604, "name": "Shaping", "slug": "shaping"}], "success": true, "attributes": []}
