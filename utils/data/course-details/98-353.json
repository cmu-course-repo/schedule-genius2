We go over the traditional pronunciation of Arabic and the special rules governing the recitation of Quran at both the phonological and semantic level. No specific background is assumed. The first goal of the course is to improve the students recitation of Quran from the current level rather than reaching a professional level in reading for everyone. That means, regardless of the students current proficiency in tajweed, we hope that by the end of the course, the students recitation will be better than before.The second goal is to learn the theoretical aspects of tajweed. The 1st textbook is the reference we are going to use and we will have a midterm and a final exam on this material. Although this is a StuCo, we will only meet once a week and the course will span the entire semester.", "short_name": "INTRO QUR'AN RECITAT", "co_reqs": [], "instructors": [{"username": "mnurulho", "first_name": "Mohammed Hafiz", "last_name": "Nurul Hoque", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 4108, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2019}], "photo_url": null}, {"username": "akamili", "first_name": "Akhyar", "last_name": "Kamili", "tags": [], "hours_per_week": 0, "id": 4107, "semesters_taught": [{"semester": 1, "year": 2019}], "photo_url": null}], "anti_reqs": [], "prereqs": {"text": "", "raw_pre_req": "", "req_obj": null}, "is_req_repeatable": false, "topic": null, "name": "Student Taught Courses(StuCo): Intro to Qur'an Recitation", "base_name": "Student Taught Courses(StuCo): Intro to Qur'an Recitation", "skills": [], "success": true, "attributes": []}
