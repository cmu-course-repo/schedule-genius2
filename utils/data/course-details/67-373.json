Rather, they work hard to build sustainable, maintainable solutions and partner capacity. You will gather your client's articulated requirements and you will seek to understand and address their unspoken requirements.\nThroughout the semester you will work to deliver and integrate a working solution to your client's satisfaction into their organization.
