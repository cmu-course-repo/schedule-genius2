Cycle 1 is an immersive short cycle (5 weeks) intended to introduce students to the various innovation types and tools, and provide practice in the tools of innovation through individual and group assignments. In Cycle 2, students are regrouped and tasked with selecting a real world challenge to apply the tools learned in Cycle 1 over a period of 10 weeks. The selection of the team projects will require students to define the problem, the stakeholders, their actual needs, and to clearly state the opportunity for improvement. Project teams will focus on developing a minimum viable product (MVP) that implements their ideas. These can include but are not limited to: systems, frameworks, apps, or iterated prototypes for highly complex solutions. The end result will either be a working implementation that embodies this improvement, or for more complex challenges, a functioning prototype that demonstrates that the improvement is possible.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "67-373 Information Systems Consulting Project is a prerequisite course.", "assessment_structure": "Grades in this course are determined by student performance in several areas: Individual Homework Assignments and Reflections (9%); Team Project Assignments (43%); Team Project Proposal (5%); Team Sprint Reports (7%); Team Presentations (6%); Final Deliverables and Project Review (30%).", "goals": "Course goals include 1 Describe the building blocks of innovation including the drivers, sources, methods, types, and benefits. 2 Create innovative solutions products or systems to address real world situations that meet user needs. 3 Apply best practices in agile project management to make plans, organize projects, align resources, monitor obstacles to success and design strategies to overcome them, and achieve desired outcomes. 4 Identify and involve users, stakeholders, industry mentors and faculty advisors in the innovation process and make informed decisions on suggestions and feedback.
