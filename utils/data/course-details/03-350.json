What are the fundamental questions that development poses 2 To understand the experimental strategies that biologists use to study development. This includes both an appreciation of basic scientific method the formulation and experimental testing of hypotheses and an understanding of specific experimental strategies commonly used by biologists to study development. 3 To gain an understanding of the current state of scientific knowledge concerning the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that underlie development. This is the factbased part of the course. Our focus will not be on memorizing everything that has been learned about development in all model organisms but on a thorough understanding of major concepts. We will also highlight what is NOT understood about this process i.e., important gaps in our current knowledge. 4 To understand the close relationship between developmental processes and human healthmedical science. 5 To be able to contribute productively to the resolution of important societalethical issues associated with human reproduction and development.", "relevance": "This course is relevant to students in biology, pre-medicine and related fields (e.g, psychology, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience) who seek an introduction to the genetic and cellular mechanisms that control the development of multicellular organisms.", "learning_resources": "n", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "equiv": [], "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "min_units": 9.0, "offering_tags": [{"sem": 2, "type": "INFO", "name": "specific_sem"}], "units": 9.0, "website": null, "long_desc": "How does a complex, multicellular organism arise from a single cell How do cells with identical genomes acquire distinctive properties What are the medical consequences of abnormal embryonic development How does regeneration occur How has evolution modified developmental programs to produce different body plans These are some of the central questions in the field of developmental biology.
