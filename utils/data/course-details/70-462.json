Probability and statistics: students should be familiar with the basic concepts of probability, including random variables and probability distributions. However, we will review the useful concepts in class.\n\n\n2. Excel skills: students should be familiar with Microsoft Excel and basic Excel formulas and functionalities. We will spend time building spreadsheet models and will review some basic skills as needed.", "assessment_structure": "Students will be assessed based on the following components: five homework assignments, two exams (mid-term and final), and a team project. There will also be a participation score.", "goals": "After completing the course students should acquire the following skillsModel uncertainty and risk quantitatively using probabilistic tools.Develop computational models for managerial simulation using appropriate software.Generate probabilistic distributions for outputs e.g., profit, waiting time, etc. and relevant performance metrics e.g., average, standard deviation, distribution tails.Communicate outputs of uncertainty analyses and implications for managerial decisions.", "relevance": "This will be a hands-on course on business risk and uncertainty.

Recognizing that most businesses are subject to high levels of variability, risk and uncertainty, it will adopt a stochastic approach to characterize the behavior of business systems and processes, and explore the effects of alternative decisions in this context.  Two modeling methodologies will be covered i stochastic modeling, and ii stochastic simulation. Examples are drawn from different managerial domains, such as supply chain management, risk management, marketing, and project management. The lectures, homework assignments, exam and term project will focus on modeling, computational, and analytical skills. Computational implementations will be done in Excel using the Risk addin during the first half of the course to build simple simulation models and the Arena software during the second half of the course to build more complex models based on discreteevent simulation.    This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the thirdparty course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the thirdparty course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the Universitys cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from 13 to 75.", "short_name": "UNCERT RISK MODELING", "co_reqs":
