In this course, we will use different pedagogical tools (In-class activities, props, online modules, lecture slides...) to keep students engaged and to make the concepts easy to understand. In addition we will have various assessment types (weekly quizzes, problem sets, tests...) to gage students' proper understanding of the taught science. This course builds on previous knowledge that students have acquired in other courses (prerequisite courses like Honors modern Biology and Biochemistry) to give them a deeper and more detailed understanding of how the cell works. Finally, this course will require from you, beside some memorization effort, to think critically about scientific data and experimental procedures and to work collaboratively with other students (e.g. end-of-semester cell bio fair project). These are important skills that will empower your growth as a scientist inside and outside the lab.",

Over the course of the semester, we will tackle complex multifaceted business problems. Think of examples like, bike-share and the \"share-economy,\" international trade and supply chain, AI and the impact on work. For each case, we will work to apply the three lenses. A pillar for the semester is that business problems are not siloed in narrow disciplines, we must draw resources from disciplines across the entire university. The second pillar of our class is solving all problems - across all of society - requires your understanding of business science.

Mathematical optimization techniques have been applied for decades in the context of logistics, supply chain management, and strategic planning, with great success. In this course, the most important methods and techniques underlying mathematical optimization are studied. These include linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming as basic mathematical methodologies. Based on these, we also consider methodologies for particular problem classes such as network models and traveling salesman problems. During the course we will emphasize mathematical modeling, that is, creating a mathematical description that reflects a given practical problem described in words. Motivated by these mathematical models, we then discuss the necessary mathematical techniques for finding optimal solutions. Lastly, we consider the solution of these problems using optimization software, i.e., we represent the mathematical models in Excel and use Excel Solver to compute an optimal solution.

We will discuss the benefits and limitations of different models and follow a practical spreadsheet-based approach to provide hands-on experience with Excel Solver. The course will build on the knowledge you have gained from the prerequisite courses; we will develop your model-building skills, explore some technique-oriented skills such as linear, integer, and nonlinear programming, and experiment with heuristic solution methods. While going through different models and techniques, we will also see real-world examples of how these models are actually used in practical business environments.

Instead of discussing pricing in isolation, we focus on the interplay between pricing and other aspects of marketing, such as positioning, branding and advertising. To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful.

The first half covers computational molecular biology and genomics. It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. The second half covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homework requiring modification of scripts to perform computational analyses. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, and neuron behavior. The imaging component includes the basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models. The course is taught under two different numbers.  The lectures are the same for both but recitations and examinations are separate. 02-250 is intended primarily for computational biology, computer science, statistics or engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had prior experience with computer science or programming. 03-250 is intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors who have had limited prior experience with computer science or programming.

What basic chemical concepts are needed as tools to understand current significant research and technology, as well as to understand phenomena and problems in the world around us?  This course will emphasize answering these questions by presenting \"problem- or context-first\", then applicable chemical concepts on an as-needed basis.  It is structured around phenomena relevant to modern society, research, and technology rather than the conceptual tools (i.e. systems- or application-, rather than content-driven).  Many of the conceptual tools (e.g. structure, interaction between energy and matter, interparticle forces, reaction stoichiometry, thermodynamics and kinetics)  are used throughout the course, to help reinforce these ideas and promote an integrated understanding.   The major contexts and phenomena that we will explore in applying and connecting chemical concepts are: (1) sustainable energy, (2) charge motion in materials, (3) natural versus engineered catalysts, (4) polymeric materials, and (5) reversible reactions in environmental and biological chemistry",

It's my hope that you'll also start to think about everyday questions from an economic lens: why were bicycles so hard to find this past summer? Is Uber surge pricing just a rip-off? Is illegal streaming bad for consumers?  Throughout the semester, we will build a toolkit to allow us to understand how these decisions interact and explain market successes, market failures, and the role of government in the marketplace. Toward the end of the semester, we'll change a few underlying assumptions and address a variety of questions related to strategic interaction.

The course is designed to provide both quantitative and theoretical foundations for the study of emerging markets. On the quantitative side, the course will introduce students to the empirical analysis of the growth forces and obstacles facing emerging markets by providing numerous hands-on opportunities using real-world data. On the theory side, the course will provide an overview of fiscal, trade and exchange rate policies adopted in emerging economies. The course will focus on successful emerging economies such as India, China, S. Korea and Ireland with broader lessons and comparisons drawn from developed countries. The course will also look at distressed economies, such as North Korea and Venezuela analyzing the challenges and opportunities faced by these developing nations today.  (Lecture, 3 hours).

Within the course, students learn genre-based skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method to learn how to use models to take on new writing tasks, including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76101 typically select textsranging from scholarly texts, journalism, and filmabout an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, research-based instruction, practice, and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear, well-supported, reader-oriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners, students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.

A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number & length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work.

In terms of content, this course is intended to overlap with World History, Islam and the European World, and US-Arab Encounters.

Using gender as a lens of examining the past, we will examine how politics of race, class, caste and religion affected and continue to impact women in South Asian countries, primarily in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Attention is drawn to the processes by which gender is socially constructed, the prevalent forms of gender disparity and discrimination, as well as the factors of change to which these are subject. These themes are situated in the broader context of the region's history, society, and culture. We will reflect upon current debates within South Asian women's history in order to examine some of the issues and problems that arise in re-writing the past from a gendered perspective. The chronological focus of this course is on the condition of women in the subcontinent from the ancient times till the present day. Students are encouraged to make comparisons between women's position and gender relations in South Asia with the corresponding situations in their societies. Analysis and appreciation of the cross-cultural aspects of women's position and gender disparity constitute integral elements of the envisaged learning outcomes of this course. It would be of general interest to all students concerned about women's position and gender issues, as well those interested in South Asia. To help us evaluate the different historical and temporal experiences of South Asian women, this course will extensively use primary documents, secondary readings, films, and contemporary newspaper and Internet articles. Students will be required to actively engage and participate in class discussions and group debates, which will form a substantial part of individual evaluations.  This course fulfills Dietrich College's \"Perspectives on Justice and Injustice\" general education requirement.",

      "description": "Historical information, artifacts, and relics provide a window to our past and help us understand our present and foresee and prepare for the future. During times of conflict and internecine warfare, it is essential to preserve objects of historical and cultural heritage. Blockchain is a block of data chained together. It does three noteworthy things: 1. digitization, 2. tracing, and 3. security. For any non-digital historical data, Blockchain can provide digitization. For any data that requires tracing, such as scientific findings, religious information, or scriptures (including Hadith/sayings of the Prophet (s)), so on, tracing can play a pivotal role in going back to the originator and understanding the change on the way, as well as preserving it from any changes (which is part of security). Blockchain also involves a mining process, which includes stakeholders that audit the information of any newly added block of data, making Blockchain auditable, which is significant for history.   Using topics from blockchain technology, history, preservation, and science, this course provides students with the grand challenge of understanding how bitcoin and cryptocurrency can assist in providing potential solutions to the problems of authorship, impermanence, managing shared ownership, and stewardship of artifacts taken through war or colonialism. Many institutions and archives are considering and advocating the merits of blockchain-based repositories. In this Grand Challenge course, we want to examine how the seemingly opposed fields of study - history and blockchain technology - can be synergized to create a futuristic museum that captures monuments and artifacts, making them accessible to future generations.",

Are there actually any objective moral truths? Morally speaking, what (if anything) is the difference between killing someone, and simply letting them die? In trying to answer these questions (and others), we'll engage in some wonderfully weird thought experiments, class discussions, smaller group discussions, debates, etc. We'll study and critique several moral theories which try to explain and help guide our moral judgments, and we'll try to apply these theories to real-life moral controversies. Past classes covered topics including drug prohibition, abortion, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. This is an introductory philosophy class, so you'll be learning how to read, critique, do, and write philosophy generally, not just ethics. Considerable time and effort, both in lectures and in recitations, will be spent helping you learn to recognize and evaluate philosophical arguments, as well as empowering you to create, improve, and defend your own arguments in class assignments.",

What makes a social media recommendation algorithm so effective and so toxic at the same time? How do online echo chambers and polarization emerge in social media platforms? Why does Linux and the broader open-source ecosystem thrive despite weak economic incentives? Why do complex software systems sometimes fail despite being well-engineered? How can you land your dream jobs and get ahead in life? How does mass adoption of technological innovations (e.g., Bitcoin) unfold? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of on- and offline connections that people form with one another. This course dives into the science of social networks, a powerful framework that offers explanations to these offline and social media phenomena. The course introduces key concepts and measures in network science with concrete examples that help to understand how tech giants, digital marketers, and top influencers stay ahead in the digital age.

      "description": "The positioning of Arab women in Arab societies (including gender roles, power, expectations, etc.) has changed over time as Arab societies underwent political and socio-cultural changes. One medium where we can see these changes is film. In this course, we examine Arab films from different periods in time, specifically prioritizing the portrayal of Arab women in them, and what this portrayal reflects about the society, culture, and politics of the time. Our classes will discuss selected films that allow us to understand the positioning of Arab women in a certain society and time period, and our discussions will be informed by readings on relevant theory/history that allow us to have a productive analysis. This course is thus relevant to students interested in both film studies and social structures, especially using film as a tool to understand social implications about Arab women in Arab societies. In this discussion-based class, students will have the opportunity to practice film analysis in class, and will build skills to eventually present an original student-led film analysis to the class.",
