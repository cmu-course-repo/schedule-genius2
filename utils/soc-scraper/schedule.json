The lectures will include (i) an examination of the history and development of evolutionary theory, (ii) consideration of some of the facts that have established the theory, (iii) an introduction to the concepts of phylogenetics, (iv) discussion of the patterns and mechanism that lead to the diversity and origins of the groups of life, (v) an introduction to genetics and population genetic theory, and (vi) discussion of and how this applies to natural selection and speciation.  The course will also include some more specialist topics, including evolution of development, sexual selection, evolutionary applications to medicine and conservation biology, and genome evolution.  Assessment will be based on several in-class exams and quizzes, homework assignments, a written term paper, and a final exam.",

From the perspective of a cancer cell, we will learn about basic concepts of cell division, DNA replication, cell signaling, cell cycle control, cell metabolism, the regulation of gene expression in human cells, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, mutations, the process of metastasis, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatments and ethical questions surrounding treating patients, the epidemiology of cancer including prevalence and historical trends in diagnosis, as well as social impacts of a cancer diagnosis. Students will also explore the primary literature and scientific review articles to better understand research and methods of investigation into the cellular and molecular processes of tumorigenesis. This course will include interactive lectures, guest speakers, and in class discussion exercises aimed at building class participation and association, as well as confidence in public speaking about the sciences. Given the well-documented link between stress and cancer, there will also be a small component aimed at making students aware of health and wellness, such as reducing stress and anxiety.",

It is a set of tools with which firms identify good investments and decide how to pay for them. Paying for them ultimately involves getting money from households. Therefore, finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economy's resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms' cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the third-party course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the third-party course material provided.

Managers of an organization are responsible for diagnosing challenges, analyzing applications, formulating strategies, building innovative teams, leveraging innovation for competitive advantages and sustained success.

It explores an understanding of matter and the energy changes associated with it, beginning with the atom.  It then overviews how atoms interact and react to form the more complicated structures of molecules and ionic compounds.  How the structure of elements and compounds affects their properties, function, and reactivity will then be explored.  Finally, the quantification of the changes during the reactivity of substances through bond breaking and forming will be investigated in single and multiple phase reactions, such as acid-base and redox reactions.  Topics will be presented to promote mastery of \"depth over breadth of topics\" and \"conceptual understanding before using applicable equations\".  The course covers the major principles of atomic structure, chemical bonding, , molecular structures of organic and inorganic compounds (including some transition metal complexes), interaction of substances, multiphase reaction stoichiometry, acid-base reactions, and redox reactions.  Relevant examples will be drawn from such areas as environmental, materials, and biological chemistry.",

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.  We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data.  We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn.  We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents.  Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including natural language processing, web-based search engines, industrial applications, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making.",

It starts by motivating and defining AI, before folding over to a survey of some of its newest applications to medicine, including diagnosis, prognosis, drug discovery, and recommendations of individualized treatments, to mention just a few. Afterwards, it provides a birds-eye view of some of the major AI techniques, including machine learning, deep neural networks, recommendation systems, ranked retrieval, and probabilistic graphical models. Finally, it concludes with a discussion on some of the concerns related to AI, including ethical issues, job security, society, and healthcare institutions, among others.  The course comprises a balance of lectures, case studies, live demonstrations of some medical AI applications, problem-solving & programming assignments, and research tasks. The students will be exposed to industry- and research-based perspectives on AI for medicine. In addition, they will learn through a course project the nuances of working with medical data and applying AI models to solve concrete problems in healthcare.",

In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven!) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.",

These questions typically take the form: how much and what combination of things should I buy? When do we want businesses to go bust? Should the government fund student tuition?  It's my hope that you'll also start to think about everyday questions from an economic lens: why were bicycles so hard to find this past summer? Is Uber surge pricing just a rip-off? Is illegal streaming bad for consumers?  Throughout the semester, we will build a toolkit to allow us to understand how these decisions interact and explain market successes, market failures, and the role of government in the marketplace. Toward the end of the semester, we'll change a few underlying assumptions and address a variety of questions related to strategic interaction. Some of the topics we will begin to introduce include credible threats, commitment problems, and the strategic use of information.  Not open to students who have received credit for 73-100.

The course emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers' expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.",

Faculty who teach 76-101 typically select texts, ranging from scholarly texts, journalism, and film, about an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, research-based instruction, practice, and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear, well-supported, reader-oriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners, students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.

The basic idea of the course is to give you experience in developing the writing skills you will be expected to have as you make the transition from student to professional. The course will cover some foundational principles of designing multimodal writing and communication within a variety of tasks including resume and cover letter writing, proposal writing and writing instructions. Students will discern the difference between writing for general and specific audiences, and analysis of visual aids in various texts.

      "description": "\"Discourse\" is language: people talking or signing or writing. Discourse analysts ask and answer a variety of questions about how and why people do the things they do with language. We study the structure of written texts  the semi-conscious rules people use to organize paragraphs, for example  as well as the unconscious rules that organize oral discourse such as spontaneous stories and arguments. We study how people signal their intended audience-interpretations of what they say as foreground or background information, a casual remark or solemn promise, more of the same or change of topic. We look at how grammar is influenced by what people need to do with language, and how discourse affects grammar over time. We ask how children and other language learners learn how to make things happen with talk and writing. We ask how people learn what language is for, from exchanging information to writing poetry to perpetuating systems of belief. We analyze the choices speakers and writers make that show how they see themselves and how they relate to others. (Choices about how to address other people, for example, both create and reflect relationships of power and solidarity). We study how people define social processes like disease, aging, and disability as they talk about them, and how language is used to mirror and establish social relations in institutional settings like law courts and schools as well as in families and among friends. This course touches on a selection of these topics and gives students practice in analyzing the complex nuances of language. The course is meant for anyone whose future work is likely to involve critical and/or productive work with language: writers and other communication designers, critics who work with written or spoken texts, historians, actors, sociologists, and so on.",

A critical lens is applied to assess how gender and racial structures influence Muslim portrayal, exploring both the perpetuation and the challenge to the perception of Muslims as religious and political outsiders. This course encourages students to critically engage with modern media portrayals of Muslims, using examples such as the TV shows \"Ramy\" and \"Man Like Mobeen\" that attempt to counter anti-Muslim tropes. Through the use of survey data, quotes, and speeches like Riz Ahmed's address to the U.K. House of Commons, this course explores the significance of media representation and its impact on the lived experiences of marginalized groups. Through collaborative and individual learning activities, students will integrate diverse information sources, reflecting on the detrimental impact of stereotypes versus the empowering effect of accurate representation. The course aims to foster an understanding of the evolving media landscape and the importance of inclusive narratives that challenge the homogenization of Muslim identities.",

Using gender as a lens of examining the past, we will examine how politics of race, class, caste and religion affected and continue to impact women in South Asian countries, primarily in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Attention is drawn to the processes by which gender is socially constructed, the prevalent forms of gender disparity and discrimination, as well as the factors of change to which these are subject. These themes are situated in the broader context of the region's history, society, and culture. We will reflect upon current debates within South Asian women's history in order to examine some of the issues and problems that arise in re-writing the past from a gendered perspective. The chronological focus of this course is on the condition of women in the subcontinent from the ancient times till the present day. Students are encouraged to make comparisons between women's position and gender relations in South Asia with the corresponding situations in their societies. Analysis and appreciation of the cross-cultural aspects of women's position and gender disparity constitute integral elements of the envisaged learning outcomes of this course. It would be of general interest to all students concerned about women's position and gender issues, as well those interested in South Asia. To help us evaluate the different historical and temporal experiences of South Asian women, this course will extensively use primary documents, secondary readings, films, and contemporary newspaper and Internet articles. Students will be required to actively engage and participate in class discussions and group debates, which will form a substantial part of individual evaluations.",

How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations.  The real excitement of data science is in the doing.  This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.  While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained.

The course is structured around the concept of a Wellness Wheel, a model for personal wellness that is used to describe the various areas that students should reflect upon when describing, and ultimately improving, their overall wellness. The MCS Wellness Wheel has nine components: intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, environmental, institutional or community, financial, social, and occupational health. During this third course, taken in the first mini of the senior year, students will select one of three areas on which to focus: financial, social and occupational health. They will be asked to engage in a recursive, reflective process to assess their own level of wellness, participate in wellness activities on campus or develop short-term goals and longer-term goal in this area, and identify possible resources that promote this aspect of wellness. Students should expect to devote 9-14 hours to the development and articulation of their plan in order to earn a passing grade. These hours are tied to completion of the requested assessments and not to the activities students' elect to pursue in fulfillment of their wellness plan.  THIS COURSE IS FOR SENIORS ONLY.",

Readings of historical and philosophical character complement the core content. This on-line course is supplemented, indeed given additional grounding, by weekly meetings in very small groups. There, we have collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections.  The central question of the course is this:  How can we analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation?  An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic.",

Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.  The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.",
