    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p class="text-left">This course introduces the role and responsibilities of the Product Manager in a technology-intensive product or services company. The over-arching goal of the course is to give you the knowledge and tools you need to make good product decisions so that your team can ship the right product, to the right customers, through the right channels, at the right price.

Along the way, we will look at many of the core activities and tasks that an effective Product Manager needs to master, including:Understanding value propositions and customer priorities, Identifying and selecting customer and market segments, Packaging and bundling capabilities and benefits into a cohesive set of offerings, Selecting pricing models and setting specific prices, Estimating the likely benefits and costs of proposed product enhancements, Modeling and evaluating the financial implications of product choices, Managing the full product life cycle, from conception to sunsetting.
