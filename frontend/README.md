The chosen frontend is Svelte, it follows an intuitive structure where
everything is a component and is closer to vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

In comparison to other frameworks, since it is compiled before serving a user
it leads to faster running times and a smaller page bundle. 

Some of the concerns of using any framework is the maintainability and also
future support. In our case, Svelte is the easiest and quickest framework to 
learn which is part of the reason its picked. It's also very maintainable 
in comparison to React and Angular etc. Svelte doesn't have the backing 
of major organizations but is running strong and the tooling is mature enough
to use. For our purposes it's deemed fit and should be fit for the future, the bulk 
of our program is going to be hand rolled, some of which might be open sourced in the 
future to contribute to the ecosystem.
